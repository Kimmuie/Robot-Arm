**Robotarm** is a term that can refer to various types of robotic arms used in different applications. These robotic arms are mechanical devices designed to mimic and perform tasks similar to the movements of a human arm. They typically consist of multiple segments or links connected by joints, allowing for a wide range of motion.

This project is created in a computer and robotics class as the final project of grade 11, semester 2. It involves using Arduino for control, designing structures using Onshape, and then 3D printing the designs.

**Component List**
- Servo Motor 4 pcs
- Variable Resistor 4 pcs
- Plastic Structure 6 pcs 
- Arduino Uno

And here is what the project looks like. I have uploaded a video on YouTube, and the link is provided below.
